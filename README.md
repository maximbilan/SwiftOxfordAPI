## Initialization

First of all you have to generate API ID and APP key.
And then use the following code:
```swift
SwiftOxfordAPI.shared.start(appId: "APP_ID_HERE", appKey: "APP_KEY_HERE")
```

## Using

Right now the framework is supported only two requests: `entries` and `translation`.
For example:
```swift
SwiftOxfordAPI.shared.entries(language: "en", word: "queen", region: "us", filters: "grammaticalFeatures=singular,past;lexicalCategory=noun") { [weak self] (data, error) in
    self?.handleResponse(data, error)
}
```

```swift
SwiftOxfordAPI.shared.translation(sourceLanguage: "en", word: "queen", targetLanguage: "es") { [weak self] (data, error) in
    self?.handleResponse(data, error)
}
```

## To do:

Unfortunately, I stopped working on this repository because I don't need it for the moment.
It's not difficult to expand the methods, just follow the implemented code. There is a list below of services which were already implemented. So, If you need more, please create a pull request with implemented services, I'll accept it.

- [x] Entries
